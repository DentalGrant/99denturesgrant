Denture wearer? Please keep them in top shape! Understand the difference between full and partial dentures and know regular cleaning is critical for appearance and oral health. Dive into our guide for the best denture care and maintain that confident smile.

## Types of Dentures

Now let's talk about the different types of dentures you can choose from to give you a smile you'll love!

When it comes to dentures, there are several options available to meet your specific needs.

The most common types of dentures include full, partial, implant-supported, and immediate.

Complete dentures are used when all of your natural teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when you still have some natural teeth remaining.

Implant-supported dentures provide a more secure and stable fit by attaching to dental implants; immediate dentures are temporary ones placed immediately after tooth extraction.

Each type of denture has advantages and considerations, so it's essential to consult your dentist to determine which option is best for you.

## Cleaning and Care Instructions for Dentures

Cleaning your dentures and establishing a routine routine is essential to keep your pearly whites sparkling and fresh.

You can start by removing and rinsing your dentures under running water to remove any loose debris.

Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and a non-abrasive denture cleaner or mild dish soap to brush your dentures, paying close attention to all surfaces.

Avoid toothpaste or abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the denture surface.

After brushing, rinse your dentures again to remove any remaining cleaner.

It's also essential to clean your mouth and gums.

Use a soft toothbrush or gauze pad to gently brush your gums, tongue, and palate to remove plaque or bacteria.

Finally, when not wearing your dentures, please keep them in a cleaner or a cup of water to prevent them from drying out.

Remember to follow these cleaning and care instructions regularly to ensure the longevity and hygiene of your dentures.

Be sure to also brush your gums, tongue, and palate with a soft-bristled toothbrush to stimulate circulation and keep your mouth clean.
